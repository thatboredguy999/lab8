There are four different folders with four diffent programs running in different program types...

PYTHON
For the python program simply run it as a python program (For example "python pytest" in a linux system).
Make sure to have linux installed.
It is a hangman game (no visual) with a win or lose output and no output file.


C++
For the program in the C++ folder the program is already compiled and needs only to be run as "./ctest.out" in linux.
An example of the input and the output is as follows...
Enter hours, minutes and seconds respectively: 11
33
52
Enter stop time.
Enter hours, minutes and seconds respectively: 8
12
15

TIME DIFFERENCE: 11:33:52 - 8:12:15 = 3:21:37
